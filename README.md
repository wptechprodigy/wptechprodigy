## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# My name is âœ¨ Waheed Afolabi âœ¨

My best quality without a doubt is the ability to work in the unknown.

iOS has thousands of frameworks and APIs 
(not to mention the annual changes that take place or the third-party SDKs) and so I wouldnâ€™t evaluate myself on what I know.

I would rather evaluate myself based on my ability to achieve great accomplishments in an environment where I knew nothing.
